assum invoiceId starting from 2210 + 1.
* please generate my SQL insert for 2000 records randomly, consider that:
products starts from productId:1 to 144
customers starts from customerId:1 to 49

qty>0 mostly => 1  : 80% of the records is 1
discount can be 0
price always >0
total >0 ==> total = price*qty - discount
mostly no discounts mean 70% of the records do not have discounts
total_points can be >=0 
IsPromotion can be 0 or 1
IsDiscount 0 or 1 if discount>0 then IsDiscount =1
redeem always <total_points
redeem can be 0
invoice_date is random between '2023-01-01 10:25' to '2024-09-05 15:02'
- no repeated productId in same invoice
- invoice should have at least 2 different products and maximum 5 products
- save result as txt file

redeem (int)  to be a random number between 0 and total_points
