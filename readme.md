## 1. Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>

The goal of this project is to perform market basket analysis using the Apriori algorithm to identify product associations from transactional data. This technique allows us to generate association rules that can help in making product recommendations, such as "Customers who bought X also bought Y." These insights can be applied in retail environments for cross-selling and recommendation systems to improve customer experience and increase sales.

This project uses:

The Apriori algorithm to find frequent itemsets and generate association rules.
Real-world retail data to identify patterns of frequently bought products.

## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

### Step 1: Create a Virtual Environment

We recommend creating a virtual environment to manage dependencies for the project:

`python -m venv venv`

Activate the virtual environment:

- On Windows:
  `venv\Scripts\activate`

- On Mac/Linux:

`source venv/bin/activate`

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Once the virtual environment is activated, install the necessary libraries using the `requirements.txt` file:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

The required dependencies include:

- pandas
- scikit-learn
- numpy
- mlxtend
- apyori
- openpyxl
